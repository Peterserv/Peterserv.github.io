<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were banned by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach structure and the 4 elements of management, aspects that affect profitable, safe, and affordable food production at a larger scale and their implications for international food security must likewise be included in an IPM design.</p>
