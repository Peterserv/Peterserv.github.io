<p>A comprehensive knowledge of general IPM concepts and various management choices for all possible pest issues is necessary as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We usually advise pest control chemicals that get the job done utilizing the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option). These prevention and control methods include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulatory approaches.</p>
<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches along with its selection of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Identification of the pest, understanding its biology and seasonal population patterns, damaging life phases and their habitats, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for one or more control options, host preference and alternate hosts, predictability of pest event based upon the environment, cropping patterns, farming practices, and other influencing factors, and all the related details is critical for determining an effective control strategy. </p>

The size of the property, the amount of pesticide used, the variety of team required to complete the job and the method of pest control done, everything is considered before the final cost is revealed.</p>
