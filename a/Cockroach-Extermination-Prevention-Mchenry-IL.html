<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is generally used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
