Adoption of IPM can be viewed under a continuum, beginning with systems largely restricted to using a single tactical approach such as utilizing financial thresholds for much better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>Pest control is an incredibly important measure owing to the truth that a number of pests are carriers of hazardous disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control specialists often use scents traps as a means to keep an eye on pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
<p>Typically, the main aim of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now developed to include illness, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management goals of sites such as residential and industrial structures, lawn and grass locations, and house and community gardens.</p>
