Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>Monitoring and identification reduces the risks of utilizing the incorrect type of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other methods will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control technique is that it's considered to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned up.
