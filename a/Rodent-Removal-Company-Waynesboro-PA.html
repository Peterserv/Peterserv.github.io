<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to integrate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and neighborhood levels and to think about the results of these practices on the total fauna, dietary state, and balance of local environments (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to describe a methodical approach of handling pests using non-chemical pest management techniques and the judicious usage of pesticides when pest populations exceed appropriate levels.</p>
<p>Monitoring and recognition decreases the risks of using the wrong kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more reliable. The benefit of the misting pest control technique is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned up. Cultural practices - count on a method to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by hindering their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both immatures and grownups.</p>
