<p>Biological pest control procedures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions.
