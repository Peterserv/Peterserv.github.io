Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is commonly understood, is a system of handling pests which is developed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Freezer is also considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it at least stops their advancement and additional feeding on the kept crop.</p>
<p>Preventing specimens from being assaulted and harmed by pests is a major challenge of collection management. Some require long-term agreements that cost $400 or more even though for the majority of pests, a single treatment succeeded need to be enough. As soon as the committee comprehends the kinds of pests that may get in the structure and possibly damage collection materials, the next step is to establish an IPPM program to address the identified needs. </p>
