<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other approaches of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes initial task is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
