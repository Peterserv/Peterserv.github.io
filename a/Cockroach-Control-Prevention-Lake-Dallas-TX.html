Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the eradication of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control experts often use scents traps as a means to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new idea. </p>
<p>The number of plants examined will depend on elements such as the value of the crop, prospective issues and size and type of greenhouses.
