<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very efficient in triggering considerable decreases in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural enemies or saving natural enemy populations by providing havens or avoiding practices that hurt them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>The success of control methods should be measured using indicators based upon monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and effect on the environment. These include the resurgence of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
