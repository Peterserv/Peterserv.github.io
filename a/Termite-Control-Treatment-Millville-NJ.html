<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of large, pricey houses, so pest control expenses could be greater there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those homes. </p>
<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all methods. This chapter discusses different methods to maintain pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM).
