<p>Household pests like ants, cockroaches, and rodents can be a lot more than a problem - they can end up being a risk to your property and potentially your health. Before introducing a crop into a greenhouse it is important to remove weeds, algae, animal plants," and any plant and growing medium debris located throughout the greenhouse, especially below benches, due to the fact that these offer haven for arthropod pests.</p>

Due to any variety of reasons, consisting of those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural areas, compromising the efficiency of natural opponents frequently enables potential pest organisms to experience essentially unregulated population development and allows them to reach pest status. </p>
