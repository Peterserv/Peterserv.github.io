Control - Strategically place animal traps or insect bait stations in under sinks, in cabinets and behind furniture to both determine pests and eliminate them prior to they become a repeating issue.

If a lot of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is caused hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
