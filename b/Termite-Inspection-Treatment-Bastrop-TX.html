<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other approaches of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
