<p>Sadly, the greater Tampa Bay location is house to plenty of spiders, and you have actually likely stumbled upon them inside your house. Consider alternative techniques (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building.
