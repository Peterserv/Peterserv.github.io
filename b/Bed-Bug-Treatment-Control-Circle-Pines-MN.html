<p>Mission Declaration: The mission of Mosquito Control is to supply Leon County locals with effective and environmentally sound mosquito control services. Much like us, pests need shelter, food, and water to survive, and if they can't find these in your house, it's likely they'll go in other places. Pests can not make it through without food and will not infest a structure if they can not enter it. Another method involves utilizing baits that either ruin the pests or prevent them from reproducing.

<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and thinks about a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). Many pesticide issues are triggered by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
<p>Mechanical controls-- Must a pest reach an inappropriate level, mechanical methods are the first choices. Save 10% on initial pest control services.
