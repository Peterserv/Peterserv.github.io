<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protects environment through removal of unnecessary pesticide applications. These professionals understand the effect of pesticides and ensure they utilize the proper ones (in the correct amount) and apply it in such a way that you and your household are exposed to little or no risk after the application.
