Biological pathogens: Bacillus thuringiensis, also referred to as Bt, is a soil-borne bacterium that combats mosquitoes and insects in the larval, caterpillar phase.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
