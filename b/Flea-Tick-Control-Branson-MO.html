<p>Pest control is an exceptionally important procedure owing to the truth that a variety of pests are carriers of harmful disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing new to pest control-- pest control experts frequently utilize scents traps as a way to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all methods. This chapter talks about different methods to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep family pets and children far from locations where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
