<p>The goal of innovation must be to secure and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal use of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. Documents would be difficult to obtain even if collective efforts were made due to the numerous potential causes for long-term and brief illnesses and signs associated with exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which allowed local farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will make sure favourable economic condition, eco-friendly and social effects 13 and applies to a lot of agricultural, public health and feature pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular tracking showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the cost of the control procedures.</p>
<p>Crop ranges can differ significantly in their susceptibility to pests and illness.

Physical barriers such as fences, internet, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and reduce the damage they cause.</p>
