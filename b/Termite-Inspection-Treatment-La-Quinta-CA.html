<p>New generation of GPS, sensors-fitted farm equipment, e-tablets, and mobile applications (Plantix) could be used for future pests and diseases recognition and monitoring 47 Since implementation of IPM programs depends mostly on info, it is expected that a giant action being taken in locations such as principles of insect sampling, computer programming and mathematics, understanding of pests biological and environmental aspects, and simulation strategies and modeling 11 In addition, meteorological and geostatistical computer models can revolutionize forecasting and tracking of insect pests, which, eventually improve decision-making for IPM.</p>
<p>Our pest control termite service is safe for kids, family pets, pregnant females and individuals with allergic reaction.
