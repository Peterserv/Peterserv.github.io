Understanding of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural opponents helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
