Pests are a major risk that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources. Biological insecticides, stemmed from naturally occurring microbes (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi ), likewise fall in this classification.</p>
<p>The report goes over the value of pest control as well as the dangers of pesticide usage. Alternatively, various approaches of biological control can be utilized including sterilisation programs.
