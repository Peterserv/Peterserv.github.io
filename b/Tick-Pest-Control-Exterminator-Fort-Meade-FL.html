<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about ten years, generally among researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are often monocultures, including a single crop types, which produces a homogenous habitat typically lacking essential requirements of natural enemies, thus favoring pest types.</p>
<p>Enhancement through propagation and release of natural opponents is an area of biological control that has received much attention recently. This component handles the management aspect of the brand-new IPM model for data collection, company, and actual actions versus pest infestations. This concentrates on monitoring the life cycles and frequency of pests to identify the best pest control methods for the present and following growing season.</p>

These are numerous termite control companies, but only HICARE uses best-in-class chemicals: HICARE'S TERMIN-8 is a non-repellent chemical that entirely kill even the last termite present.</p>
