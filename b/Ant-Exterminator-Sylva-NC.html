<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature.

<p>Shop pesticides in their initial containers. In addition to the reasons suggested in Table 3, due to the fact that of differences in climate, pests, soil, variety and other aspects, a well-developed IPM program for a crop in a specific area might not necessarily work well in another scenario.
