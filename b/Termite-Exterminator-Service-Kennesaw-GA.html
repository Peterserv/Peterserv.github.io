<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a economical and ecologically benign pest control strategy ideally suited for both small and large farmers around the globe. Once termites have actually gotten in a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more.
