<p>Integrate row covers with crop rotation if you're handling pests that overwinter in the soil.

For instance, feeding activities of certain caterpillars on the leaves of potatoes and tomatoes cause a systemic production of protease inhibitors expressed throughout the plant that interfere with the digestion procedure and feeding behavior of insects (36 ).</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, VladÃ©s et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in current decades considering that fire kills helpful insects together with the pests and can have an unfavorable influence on the soil. To lessen possible damage to helpful insects, limit your spraying to little locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
