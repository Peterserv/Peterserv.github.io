<p>Having some basic concept of the costs for different pest treatments services will absolutely help you deal with them on better terms. D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
