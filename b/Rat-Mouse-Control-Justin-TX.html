<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has been in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxins are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and additional feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>The decision of the proper cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>Pesticides are either unscheduled or they fall under schedules 5, 6 or 7. Each schedule has a caution, which appears in large contrasting lettering on the label.
