As soon as recognition, monitoring, and action thresholds show that pest control is required, and preventive approaches are no longer efficient or available, IPM programs then examine the appropriate control technique both for efficiency and danger. The letter of invitation for this plenary address suggested for its title the main style of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and recognize them precisely, so that suitable control choices can be made in combination with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the significant pattern has been towards the use of modern chemistry and molecular biology to change conventional pesticides with less hazardous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these means are still therapies.</p>
